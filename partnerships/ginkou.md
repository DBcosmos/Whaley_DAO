# üè¶ Ginkou

{% embed url="https://ginkou.io/" %}

Ginkou is a money market offering users the opportunity to lend or borrow crypto assets. Lenders, also known as depositors, earn interest (APY) on their asset (USDC) by lending them to other users.

In a Decentralised finance (DeFi) money market, anyone can participate either as a lender or a borrower. Lenders deposit their assets into the platform and earn interest on their deposits, while borrowers can take loans by providing collateral.

Whaley DAO is proud to collaborate one of Cosmos' most innovative Money Markets
