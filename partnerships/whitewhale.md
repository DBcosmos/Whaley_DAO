White Whale (WW) is an Interchain Liquidity Solutions protocol. WW creates a unifying hub for a token‚Äôs liquidity and then sub-divides this token‚Äôs liquidity in LPs across all the cosmos chains it's deployed on, distributing liquidity where it is most needed. With hundreds of future blockchains coming to the cosmos ecosystem, liquidity will be severely fragmented across the blockchains with shallow LPs. WW‚Äôs architecture combats this by creating: (i) greater capital efficiency for the token liquidity because token liquidity is a coordinated pool of pools rather than multiple independent pools and (ii) improved inter-chain price stability because of greater coordinated liquidity.

Whaley DAO is proud to collaborate with this Layer One blockchain and dApp team to achieve their goal of stabilising prices across the IBC
